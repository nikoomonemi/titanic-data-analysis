Titanic Dataset Analysis
 Overview
This analysis explores key factors influencing passenger survival on the Titanic. The dataset includes demographic and social information such as gender, age, passenger class, and family relationships aboard the ship.
- Gender and Survival Rate:
The survival rate for females was significantly higher than for males — approximately 74% for females compared to 18% for males.
This strong difference suggests that gender played a major role in determining survival, likely due to the “women and children first” evacuation policy.
- Passenger Class (Pclass):
Passenger class also had a clear effect on survival outcomes:
Females in first class had the highest survival rate among all groups.
Males in second class showed a relatively better survival rate compared to males in other classes.
Overall, passengers from higher classes had better access to lifeboats and, therefore, a greater chance of survival.
- Age Distribution:
The average age of survivors was approximately 28 years, while those who did not survive had an average age of about 30 years.
Although the difference is small, it suggests that younger passengers might have had a slightly better chance of survival.
- Family Size (SibSp & Parch):
An analysis of the SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard) and Parch (number of parents/children aboard) variables shows that:
Passengers who were alone or had large families tended to have lower survival rates.
Those with a small number of family members (typically 1–2) had the highest chance of survival.
This indicates that being accompanied by a small family group may have offered social or logistical advantages during evacuation.
- Summary:
Overall, survival on the Titanic was strongly influenced by gender, class, and family size.
Women, first-class passengers, and those traveling with a small family had a significantly higher chance of survival.
